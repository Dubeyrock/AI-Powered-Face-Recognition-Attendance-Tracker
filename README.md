# face-recognition-based-attendance-system  

## Project Overview:

The SmartFace Attendance System uses facial recognition technology to automate attendance marking. By analyzing unique facial features, such as the distance between the eyes and shape of the nose, the system accurately identifies individuals in real-time. It compares captured faces to a pre-registered database and records attendance when a match is found.

This system adapts to variations in lighting, facial expressions, and aging, ensuring consistent and reliable performance. It offers a contactless, secure, and efficient solution, reducing proxy attendance and enhancing security in educational institutions, offices, and events.
